                                        Personal Loans have the simplest method of operation.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Let us take a look at the working of personal loans. The processes mentioned
                                        here can differ from lender to lender.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The applicant applies to the lender for a certain amount. Based, on the
                                        eligibility of the applicant, the lender issues an offer with the final loan
                                        amount, processing charges, interest rate and the tenure and indicative broken
                                        period of the loan.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        If the applicant likes the offer, they sign a loan agreement. A loan agreement
                                        is a legal contract between the lender and borrower.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The loan amount is disbursed to the applicant, upon signing the loan agreement.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The processing fee involved can be paid by the borrower separately or deducted
                                        from the loan amount.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Loan amount is always disbursed one time and in full to the borrower. The
                                        borrower, then can utilize the money as per their need and purpose. They do not
                                        need to inform the lender about the usage of the loan amount.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Loan repayment starts once the broken period is over. An EMI is deducted per
                                        month from the borrowers account on a previously agreed date. The deduction can
                                        be through either of the following: NACH, ECS or cheques depending on the loan
                                        agreement. This deduction goes on till the full tenure or until the prepayment
                                        by the borrower.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In lieu of the loan amount provided, the lender charges some amount on top of
                                        the principal amount. This extra amount is call the interest. Interest is always
                                        a certain percentage of the principal amount. This percentage is known as the
                                        interest rate.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        With some lenders, there can be additional processes involved. Also the
                                        documentation may vary depending on the borrowerâ€™s profile, until the lender is
                                        satisfied.

                                        There is no shortage of either the lenders or the loan offers. As the disbursal
                                        is fast and needs no to minimal paperwork, it is very easy to avail. Yet, it is
                                        not an easy task to find the best offer.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Comparing and choosing the best personal loan provider is always a tough task.
                                        <br><br>
                                        It is essential to understand the way they work, banks interest rates, types of
                                        loans offered: secured, unsecured, fixed, and variable, overdraft and line of
                                        credit, go through the bankâ€™s application checklist and look for the customer
                                        reviews & ratings.
                                        <br><br>
                                        There are a lot of websites to compare what is offered by each bank. Use a
                                        trustworthy website to choose the top five. Then bring down your list to top 3
                                        and then further narrow it down to the bank that has the best offer.

                                    <h6 class="heading-h6">The Interest Rate</h6>
                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        The interest rate is the first concern for most of us before applying for any
                                        loan. The total cost of a loan is determined by combining the interest rate and
                                        the length of the repayment period.
                                        <br><br>
                                        So, in order to minimize the cost of borrowing, the loan should be of
                                        low-interest rate. Also, the tenure should be short. The interest rate differs
                                        from lender to lender.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To get the lowest interest rate, one must compare the offers of several lenders.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6 class="heading-h6">Fees and Charges</h6>
                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        The next point to consider are the fee and charges you are to pay to the lender,
                                        excluding the principal and the interest component. Some lenders may have high
                                        fees like processing fee, documentation fee, etc. while some others may keep it
                                        low to attract customers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In both cases, one has to be careful enough to dig deep into the matter and find
                                        out if the lender has any hidden charges. Finalize a lender only after
                                        evaluating all the involved costs to be paid to the lender during the loan
                                        tenure.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6 class="heading-h6">Repayment Period</h6>
                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        The loan repayment period or the loan tenure should also be checked if you are
                                        trying to find the best loan offer.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Loan tenure makes a great impact on the total outgo of the loan. Some lenders
                                        may offer you a very long loan tenure to make the EMI amount smaller.
                                        <br><br>
                                        But remember the fact that, a longer tenure loan is costlier as the interest is
                                        compound interest. So, before you make any decision you can check using the EMI
                                        Calculator to determine how long it will take you to pay back the loan.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6 class="heading-h6">Repayment Flexibility</h6>
                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        Along with all other concerns, one must be aware of the repayment flexibility of
                                        the lender. As these are installment loans, hence the ideal repayment of the
                                        loan is done in EMIs for a fixed tenure.
                                        <br><br>
                                        But during the loan tenure, it may happen that you save some extra fund. And you
                                        want to pay it towards the loan repayment to save the interest payment. In such
                                        scenarios, the lender should accept the prepayment of the loan.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Some lenders may let you pay a prepayment penalty while some others may not
                                        allow you to do the same. So, apply only if the lender accepts prepayment.

                                        The Payment Protection Insurance, also known as PPI is a kind of insurance plan
                                        designed to cover any kind of loan. The PPI can cover different kinds of loans.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This type of insurance covers the loan EMIs in case of death or disability of
                                        the borrower to pay off the EMIs.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In case of job loss or such situations when you are not earning enough to pay
                                        the EMIs, you can claim the insurer to pay the EMIs until you are earning again.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Generally, the PPI is sold along with the credit product by the lender or the
                                        partner companies of your lender. Lenders generally advise you to buy a PPI as
                                        it minimizes the risk of NPA to a great extent. The PPI policies have to be
                                        purchased separately for every credit you owe.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Let's say, you have purchased a PPI for your personal loan. If you become unable
                                        to earn enough to pay off your loans, the insurer will pay the EMIs. If you have
                                        any other loans due, the insurance will not cover those loans.

                                            During that period, you are to pay the EMIs yourself.

                                    <p>The PPI policies are to be purchased if your loan amount is huge. Bigger loan
                                        amount leads to hefty EMI amount. If you are not certain about the regular
                                        payment of the EMIs, it is advisable to buy a payment protection insurance
                                        <br><br>
                                        Secondly, if your source of income is not stable, you should definitely opt for
                                        payment protection insurance. So if your income becomes less than normal, the
                                        insurance will cover the EMI payments.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If your job is associated with risk on life, you should better have PPI for you
                                        all kinds of loans. The individuals servicing risky jobs such as fighter pilot,
                                        fireman, construction foreman, private detective and so on should purchase
                                        payment protection insurance plans to cover the loan repayments.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Also, you should not neglect to buy a PPI if you are the only breadwinner of
                                        your family. If there are no other earning member in the family, you should go
                                        for PPI to safeguard your family from uncertainties of future.</p>

                                        different parameters, it results in a great number of rejected loan
                                        applications.

                                        Therefore, P2P is a great alternative to avail a loan, while skipping the
                                        hassles of banks personal loan.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In contrast to personal loans, here the lending and borrowing happens between
                                        individuals. Therefore, removing the middleman (bank/NBFC) from the process.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Such a lending happens via a platform, where the people who need to borrow and
                                        people who are willing to lend, exchange money.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This lending is a form of crowdfunding. As such, people with excess fund invest
                                        their money through such platforms. As, such a system helps them earn better ROI
                                        than other investment options.
                                        <br><br>
                                        With such platforms, the investors across the country can lend to the borrowers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Once approved, the borrower immediately receives the loan amount. The borrower
                                        repays the loan through EMIs. Which is just like any other personal loan.

                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        A peer to peer lending happens when borrowers take loans from the individuals
                                        who are ready to lend their money at an agreed interest rate. The peer to peer
                                        platforms display the loan aspirantâ€™s profile which can be accessed or checked
                                        by the investors. The investors access the profile of the loan seekers and
                                        determine the risk profile. The P2P lending is a collateral free loan hence the
                                        risk assessment is always the first priority of the investor. In a P2P lending
                                        system, a borrower may get the full amount or a portion of the amount applied
                                        for. In such scenarios, the rest of the amount may be provided by another
                                        investor. In this way, a borrower may have multiple loan sources hence the
                                        repayment of the same has to be made to each of the individual sources.

                                        The P2P loan application is much easier than applying for any other kind of
                                        loans. One just needs to put in a few pieces of personal information and the
                                        loan application can be approved within minutes. The application of a P2P loan
                                        is done online.

                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        The second benefit is the competitive interest rate. If you are earning well and
                                        have no records of defaulting loans, you are likely to get a loan cheaper than a
                                        bank loan.

                                    <p class="collapse-p">
                                        Unlike a banks personal loan, the processing fee of P2P personal loan is
                                        considerably low. Apart from interest charges, traditional banks charge a number
                                        of fees such as processing fee, documentation fee, stamp duty charges etc. If
                                        you apply for a peer to peer personal loan, you can be saved from paying all
                                        those charges.

                                        Personal Loans for the self-employed professionals are not as simple to avail as
                                        they are for salaried employees.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As such, the lenders take extra precautions, conduct additional checks and
                                        require more documentation. And they have a very reason for all such extra
                                        efforts. Unlike salaried employees, who are on a guaranteed fixed income, the
                                        monthly income of the self-employed professional varies.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Their income can soar sky-high in some months or in some particular situations.
                                        And, in some months their income might drop to a very insignificant amount.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The success of all the businesses depends on their existing market conditions.
                                        Even if, they are doing everything right, some days or months might not see any
                                        income.
                                        <br><br>
                                        A great example to understand this would be of a holiday resort. During the
                                        holiday season, it might remain over-booked. While in a non-holiday season,
                                        weeks can go without any customer.
                                        <br><br>
                                        As such, lending to self-employed people involves a higher risk for the lender.
                                        <br><br>
                                        However, certain professionals such as Chartered Accountants, Doctors,
                                        Engineers, Company Secretaries, and Architects and ICWAI graduates are offered a
                                        special loan. All the top lenders considers these as low risk profiles.

                                        NBFCâ€™s (Non Banking Finance Companies) or P2P lending platforms without asking
                                        for any collateral, guarantor or hypothecation of any assets. The ultimate usage
                                        of a personal loan is left to the discretion of the borrower. In our experience,
                                        the borrowers generally use a personal loan for debt consolidation, repaying
                                        high cost debt, meeting any family or medical emergency, wedding, vacations,
                                        home renovation, rental deposits, business needs for an SME, buying certain

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The company where you work. Every bank has a list of companies running into
                                            thousands which they have categorised into segments like A, B, C etc
                                            depending on the credentials and financials of your employer. The higher the
                                            category the higher is the loan eligibility chances.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Quantum of loans and credit card outstanding that you already have.
                                            Typically a bank will not give a loan if the total EMI obligation (including
                                            the current personal loan that your are trying to apply for) exceeds 50-75%
                                            of your total net take home salary.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Your gross/net salary</li>
                                        <li>Your credit score as reflected in your CIBIL or Equifax report. Having a
                                            good credit score is a necessary but not a sufficient criteria.
