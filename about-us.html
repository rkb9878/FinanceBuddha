                <p>
                    We are not yet another online offer comparison site. While we do
                    give you the most exhaustive range of options, we do the last mile
                    and get you the loan also. We strongly believe that financial
                    services is not like an ecommerce business where products are
                    standardized and hence the cheaper the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every borrower has a unique financial position and requirement.
                    Hence, we always have a dedicated sales manager to advise you on the
                    best bank to choose, do the initial documentation, answer bank
                    queries on your behalf, negotiate on your behalf, complete the loan
                    documentation and ensure disbursal to your account
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are able to do this because we have strong in house team of 200
                    people spread across 12 cities. The senior management consists of
                    people who have held leadership roles with banks/NBFC’s like
                    Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bajaj Finserve, GE Money etc. It
                    is entirely due to the efforts of our loyal employees (attrition of
                    less than 5% over the last 4 years) that we are currently disbursing
                    more than 1,000 cr annually within a short company lifespan of 4
                    years
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have embarked on an exciting journey to make the process even
                    simpler and streamlined for the customer. We are in the process of
                    developing proprietary algorithms which can help us in giving the
                    customer a more incisive suggestion on the best product/bank to
                    choose from.
