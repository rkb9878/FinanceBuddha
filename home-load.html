                                        Home loans are considered among one of the best credit products. Home loans are
                                        designed in various ways according to the need of the homebuyer. If you take a
                                        home
                                        loan for a property which is not yet completely constructed, it is called an
                                        under
                                        construction home loan. An under construction home loan is offered by many banks
                                        in
                                        India. The disbursal of the loan amount is done in small parts as the
                                        construction
                                        progresses. The builder will pay interest on this loan amount until the
                                        construction
                                        is completed and the home is handed over to the buyer. The customer will start
                                        paying EMI for the same only after possession. The builder and the loan provider
                                        will have an agreement stating when the loan will be disbursed by the bank and
                                        at
                                        what stages of the project. The lender will justify if the builder has completed
                                        the
                                        construction as per the agreement within the given timeframe. The lender

                                        the next instalment only if the first stage of the construction is done at the
                                        right

                                    <p class="collapse-p">Cheaper Property Price: The prime benefit of buying an under
                                        construction home is the better price. The price of a ready to move home is much
                                        higher than an under construction property. One can save a minimum of 30% - 40%
                                        of
                                        the property price while purchasing it when it is still under construction.</p>
                                    <p class="collapse-p"><b>Can negotiate with the Lender:</b> One gets an option to
                                        negotiate
                                        with the lender if the applicant's credit score is very high. A loan against
                                        property is a deal of better profit for the lender as the disbursement of the
                                        loan
                                        does not happen at once. But the interest on the total amount will start
                                        accumulation form the day of the first disbursal. Hence the profit of the lender
                                        increases. One can take advantage of the same by negotiating the interest rate
                                        as
                                        the lender will never want to lose a valued customer</p>

                                        construction property is
                                        considered one of the best ways of investment. The property price may increase
                                        by
                                        30% to 40% once the home becomes ready to move. If you sell the home at that
                                        time,
                                        you will earn a really good profit.</p>

                                        loan is higher than a general home loan. A home loan borrower can claim Income

                                        exemption on interest payments of up to ₹200,000 under section 24B and ₹150,000

                                        principal repayment under Section 80 C. A house loan taken for an under

                                        property can claim for tax benefits only after the Occupancy Certificate is

                                        from the builder. In other words, one may say that the tax benefits are

                                        only after the Possession. There is one more section, Section 80EE which

                                        Yes, you can still get a home loan tax loan rebate even if you have two separate
                                        properties both registered in your name. Even if the property is in two
                                        different
                                        cities of India, it is still possible to get home loan tax rebate. However, the
                                        limit for both together will be only upto INR 200,000 for the owner of the
                                        property.
                                        However, only one house can be claimed as self-occupied and the other should be
                                        claimed as rented or let-out. Any rent from the let-out property will be
                                        considered
                                        as part of your income for income tax evaluation for a particular assessment
                                        year.
                                        If you really want to save tax and not show as let-out then buy the other
                                        property
                                        on your spouse’s name.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Cumulative net monthly salary of the applicant and co-applicant.</li>
                                        <li>Quantum of loans and credit card outstanding that you already have.
                                            Typically a bank will not give a loan if the total EMI obligation (including
                                            the current home loan that your are trying to apply for) exceeds 50-60% of
                                            your total net take home salary.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Loan to asset Value (LTV) ratio of 75% which means that the customer has to
                                            fund the remaining 25% through his savings or any other source.
